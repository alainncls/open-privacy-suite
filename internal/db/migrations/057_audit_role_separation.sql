-- 057_audit_role_separation.sql
-- RD-858: split Postgres roles so the application identity cannot
-- silently rewrite the audit chain. Pre-fix, a single role had full
-- read/write/delete on every table — an attacker who compromised the
-- proxy host could rewrite rbac_audit_log entries and recompute the
-- chain forward in seconds. Role separation raises that bar to "the
-- attacker must also pop the dedicated admin credential" — defense in
-- depth, not a silver bullet, but the cheapest meaningful step that
-- doesn't require leaving Postgres trust boundaries.
--
-- Roles defined:
--   * privacy_proxy_app   — the runtime identity used by the proxy
--                           process.
--   * privacy_proxy_admin — operator identity for migrations, ad-hoc
--                           queries, incident response. Full DDL/DML
--                           on the entire schema. Used **rarely**,
--                           by a human via a credential that lives
--                           outside the app's secret store.
--
-- ── Permission model: explicit allowlist (NOT deny-list). ───────
--
-- Every table the app needs is enumerated below with the exact perms
-- it requires. Append-forever audit tables get INSERT + SELECT only
-- (no UPDATE / DELETE / TRUNCATE); operational tables get full CRUD.
--
-- Rationale for allowlist over the simpler "GRANT ALL then REVOKE on
-- two tables": a future audit-relevant table created in (say)
-- migration 080 would inherit blanket grants under the deny-list
-- pattern and be silently writable by the app role unless the author
-- remembers to add a REVOKE. With the allowlist pattern, forgetting
-- a GRANT means the runtime fails loudly with "permission denied"
-- the first time it touches the new table — loud-break-on-mistake is
-- the failure mode you want for compliance-sensitive grants.
--
-- ── New-table checklist (for future migration authors) ──────────
--
-- When you CREATE TABLE in a later migration, you MUST also:
--
--   1. Decide whether the table is "append-forever audit" or
--      "operational". If unsure, the safe default is append-only.
--   2. Add a GRANT block to that migration:
--      - Operational:    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
--                        ON <table> TO privacy_proxy_app;
--      - Audit:          GRANT SELECT, INSERT
--                        ON <table> TO privacy_proxy_app;
--   3. Sequences for new tables: GRANT USAGE, UPDATE ON SEQUENCE
--      <table>_id_seq TO privacy_proxy_app;  (BIGSERIAL/SERIAL
--      tables only — UUID primary keys have no sequence).
--   4. The admin role automatically gets all perms via ALL TABLES
--      grants below — no per-table action needed for privacy_proxy_admin.
--
-- ── Credential lifecycle ─────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The migration is intentionally non-prescriptive about credentials:
--   - No passwords are assigned (NOLOGIN is the default).
--   - The infra team picks the lifecycle (AWS Secrets Manager via
--     IRSA, RDS IAM authentication, HashiCorp Vault dynamic secrets,
--     plain ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD ..., etc.) and applies it via
--     their preferred mechanism after this migration runs.
--   - The operator MUST flip the roles to LOGIN before they can be
--     used.
--   - See docs/security/audit-integrity for the recommended setup
--     (AWS Secrets Manager pattern for canonical deployments).
--
-- IF the operator has NOT separated credentials yet, the migration is
-- still safe — the existing connection role (whatever credential was
-- in DATABASE_URL when migrations ran) remains untouched, with all
-- its current permissions. The new roles sit dormant until the
-- operator chooses to enable them. Non-breaking when role separation
-- is deferred.

-- ── Audit / append-forever tables: INSERT + SELECT only ──────────
-- These tables form the cryptographic audit trail. The app role
-- can append (write new rows) but cannot rewrite history. Retention
-- of these tables, when policy-permitted, is the admin role's job.

-- access_logs is special — it IS audit content, but retention prune
-- (90-day TTL + FIFO row cap) is intentional policy on this table.
-- The app role keeps UPDATE/DELETE so the retention worker continues
-- to function under the app credential. The audit_chain_anchor
-- preserves chain verifiability across prune cuts.
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON access_logs TO privacy_proxy_app;

-- audit_chain_anchor: app role writes here when retention prunes the
-- last surviving row in a chain. Read-modify-write required, so
-- INSERT + UPDATE + SELECT (no DELETE — anchor history is itself an
-- integrity signal).

-- ── Tables NOT granted to app role ──────────────────────────────
-- The following exist in the schema but have ZERO Go code references
-- in the current codebase. They are not granted to privacy_proxy_app
-- so any accidental future write attempt fails loudly:
--   - access_policies   (initial-schema artefact, never used)
--   - managed_proxies   (migration 005 artefact, no Go usage)
-- The admin role still has full access via the schema-wide grant
-- above; a future migration can drop them once confirmed unused.

COMMENT ON ROLE privacy_proxy_app IS
    'Runtime app role (RD-858). Explicit per-table allowlist: INSERT+SELECT on audit-forever tables; full CRUD on operational tables; no grants on dead tables (access_policies, managed_proxies). No password set by migration — infra team configures credential lifecycle.';

COMMENT ON ROLE privacy_proxy_admin IS
    'Admin / operator role (RD-858). Full DDL+DML. Used rarely, via credentials that live outside the app secret store. No password set by migration.';
