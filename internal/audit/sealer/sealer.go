// Package sealer drains the durable audit buffer (internal/audit/buffer) in
// sequence order and seals each entry into the tamper-evident chain via a
// caller-supplied SealFunc, then deletes sealed entries from the buffer.
//
// A single Sealer is the only writer of its chain — this is what removes the
// per-request chain mutex + 2 Postgres round-trips from the request hot path
// (RD-1112) and avoids the multi-writer chain fork.
//
// Crash-safety: the resume point is the chain's durable high-water (the max
// sealed buffer sequence already in Postgres), NOT in-memory state and NOT
// buffer membership. So a crash between the chain commit and the buffer delete
// cannot double-seal — entries at or below the high-water are skipped on the
// next drain. SealFunc must additionally be idempotent on the sequence (e.g.
// INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (buffer_seq) DO NOTHING) as defense in depth.
