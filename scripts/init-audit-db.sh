# init-audit-db.sh — Postgres docker-entrypoint-initdb.d hook (RD-1147).
#
# Runs ONCE, inside the privacy-postgres CONTAINER, the first time its data
# volume is initialised. It provisions the SEPARATE append-only audit database
# and the restricted LOGIN role so the dev stack enforces the append-only seal —
# exactly the shape production infra provisions out of band.
#
# This is the CONTAINER creating the database (mirroring how the main DB is made
# via POSTGRES_DB), NOT the app: the privacy-proxy app never runs CREATE
# DATABASE. It connects to the already-provisioned "<main>_audit" DB and runs the
# lean audit migrations against it (as privacy_proxy_admin / the owner).
#
# Env (provided by docker-compose.privacy.dev.yml):
#   POSTGRES_USER            — the owner/superuser (also the audit-admin identity in dev).
#   POSTGRES_DB              — the main database name; the audit DB is "<POSTGRES_DB>_audit".
#   AUDIT_APP_PASSWORD       — password for the restricted runtime role privacy_proxy_app.
#
# The restricted role is created here with LOGIN + a password so AUDIT_DATABASE_URL
# can connect AS privacy_proxy_app. The lean audit migration (run later by the app
# via the owner DSN) creates the role NOLOGIN if it does not exist and then grants
# it the append-only allowlist; creating it here first (with LOGIN) is compatible —
# the migration's CREATE ROLE is guarded by IF NOT EXISTS and its GRANTs apply to
# the already-existing role.
